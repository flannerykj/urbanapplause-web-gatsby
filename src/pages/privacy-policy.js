        <p>Urban Applause is an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <p>This page is used to inform visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information, for those who decide to use my Service.</p>

        <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <a to='/terms-of-service'>Terms of Service</a> on the Urban Applause website, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3 className='title is-3'>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p><b>iOS App:</b> Beyond the information Apple provides to developers that you can decide to provide, Urban Applause also uses Firebase Services within the app (Firebase's Privacy Policy can be found <a href='https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy' target='_blank'>here</a>, note that Urban Applause only uses a small subset of Firebase's many services). This helps to identify crashes and stability issues (Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring) and why they're caused (eg: a post that is crashing a lot of devices), which greatly speeds up and eases the ability to swiftly fix them. Firebase Analytics is also used within the app in order to better understand which features are being used in order to make development decisions and choose where to focus development effort. The information collected is anonymous. Urban Applause does not sell or rent your data, and the anonymous information is only collected to help make the app better.</p>

        <h3 className='title is-3'>Cookies</h3>

        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>

        <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>
